# ShaurMap
Hello and welcome to ShaurMap page. ShaurMap - IOS app that helps you navigate through all places in Belarus which do serve Shaurma in their restaurants. 
So far you can open up app and look through catalog of restaurants and go to restaurant own page to look for map, menu and etc. 

Update 25-02: Added GoogleMapsApi for displaying location in Restaurant page.

Update 27-02: Added server side. I'm storing my restaurant in Firebase Database and also I'm using Firebase Storage to store images.

Update 02-03: Changed storing logic of restaurants. Now [Restaurant] is fetched in Shared.swift and then shared between classes.

Update 03-03: Added NearMe screen, where user can select restaurant, look for basic info and get route to selected restaurant. NearMe screen is created using GoogleMaps Api.

Thanks for your time, Vova Seuruk
